Selenium is a popular open-source automated testing tool for testing web applications across several browsers.A Selenium testing tool is capable of testing the Web applications over many Web browsers like Chrome, Safari Opera, Firefox, and much more. Apart from this, you can use any of the programming languages like Perl, Java, PHP, Python, or Ruby to test the codes. Further, it is a platform-independent tool and that means you can easily deploy Selenium on Linux, Windows, and Mac.

# What is Selenium?

Selenium is a free, open-source tool for evaluating Web applications across several browsers. Selenium is capable of testing only web applications.
The Selenium has a dedicated suite of tools and it helps in easing the process of Web applications and they are,

* Selenium IDE - Integrated Development Environment
* Selenium WebDriver
* Selenium Grid

# Selenium IDE
Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is primarily a record/run tool that a test case developer uses to develop Selenium Test cases. Selenium IDE is an easy-to-use tool from the Selenium Test Suite and can even be used by someone new to developing automated test cases for their web applications. One does not require any special setup to get started with Selenium IDE. You just need to add the extension of your specific browser. Selenium IDE provides you with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for easily recording your interactions with the website.
Selenium IDE allows a user or a test case developer to create the test cases and test suites and edit it later as per their requirements. The development environment also provides the capability of converting test cases to different programming languages, which makes it easier for the user and does not mandate the need for knowing a specific programming language.

# Selenium WebDriver

WebDriver drives a browser natively, as a user would, either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server, marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.

Selenium WebDriver refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just WebDriver.
